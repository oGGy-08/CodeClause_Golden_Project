## Heart Disease Prediction Website Project

## Description:
The Heart Disease Prediction Website Project aims to create a user-friendly web application that utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on input features. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Flask web framework for the backend. The Decision Tree machine learning algorithm is employed to make accurate predictions based on the user's input data.

## Features:
1. **Homepage:** The website will have an appealing homepage introducing the project's purpose and inviting users to utilize the heart disease prediction service.

2. **Input Form:** The main feature of the website is an input form where users can enter their relevant medical data, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, etc.

3. **Validation:** Client-side validation is implemented to ensure that users provide valid and necessary information before submitting the form.

4. **Decision Tree Algorithm:** The backend is responsible for handling the user's input data, preprocessing it, and passing it to the Decision Tree machine learning algorithm.

5. **Prediction Results:** Once the prediction is made by the algorithm, the website displays the results on a new page. The user will be informed of the predicted probability of having heart disease and will receive appropriate instructions or advice.

6. **Visualizations:** For a better user experience, the website may present informative visualizations, such as charts or graphs, to illustrate the prediction factors.

7. **About Page:** An 'About' page can be included to provide more information about the project, the algorithm used, and any references or data sources.

## Technology Stack:
1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For creating the user interface and handling client-side interactions.

2. **Flask Web Framework:** For building the backend and handling user requests, data processing, and responses.

3. **Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm:** The heart disease prediction model is developed using the Decision Tree algorithm, which is trained on a dataset containing historical medical records.

4. **Python:** The programming language used to develop the backend logic and integrate the machine learning model.

## Project Workflow:
1. User visits the website and lands on the homepage.

2. User navigates to the heart disease prediction page.

3. User fills out the input form with the relevant medical data.

4. Client-side validation checks the form for errors and missing information.

5. User submits the form, sending the data to the Flask backend.

6. Flask processes the user's input data and passes it to the Decision Tree model.

7. The Decision Tree algorithm predicts the probability of the user having heart disease based on the input features.

8. The prediction result is sent back to the frontend.

9. The website displays the prediction result.

## Note: 
The success of the prediction depends on the quality and size of the dataset used to train the Decision Tree model. Regular updates and improvements are essential to ensure the model remains accurate and relevant.

## Disclaimer: 
It is important to note that the Heart Disease Prediction Website Project is for educational and informational purposes only. The predictions made by the algorithm should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. Users should always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any medical concerns or questions.
